# BinaryDecimalConverter

This is a simple Java program that converts binary numbers to decimal and vice versa. It uses a menu system and accepts input from the user's keyboard.

## Usage
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Run the `BinaryDecimalConverter` class.
3. Use the menu system to choose your conversion type.
4. Enter a value and the program will display the corresponding binary/decimal number.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed!

## Notes
- The program only converts between positive integers at present.
- The program uses the int data type throughout and therefore is not suitable for converting to/from values larger than 2147483647.
